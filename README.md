# KONTAGION
## GAME DESCRIPTION

On the left of the Petri dish, you can see our hero Socrates (pronounced “SOCK ra tease,”
or “SO crates” for fans of Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure) in his hazmat suit. Socrates
can only move clockwise and counterclockwise around the perimeter of the Petri dish –
he cannot go into the middle of it. Socrates is equipped with a poison sprayer as well as
an omni-directional flamethrower which he can use to battle the deadly bacteria. The
Petri dish contains numerous specs of dust (they look like mounds of dirt) which block
bacterial movement, as well as microscopic food particles (Dr. Evyyl has found that pizza
is a great food source for bacteria). We can also see several different types of bacteria,
which multiply as they eat the provided pizza. The blue bacteria are deadly E. coli, and
the grey bacteria are various types of salmonella (regular salmonella and nasty,
aggressive salmonella). All of the bacteria are deadly, and any time they come into
contact with Socrates they will attempt to injure him. In the middle of the Petri dish, we
see a pit leading to the area where the bacteria take their afternoon naps (after late night
ragers on toilet seats in the frats along Gayley Ave). The bacteria emerge from these
hole(s) once they wake up.

While they are not pictured in the image above, the CIA (Central Infection Agency) will
occasionally drop “goodies” down for Socrates to use in his battle. The CIA may drop
down a health kit (which can restore Socrates to full health), a charge kit to provide five
flamethrower charges, or an extra-life kit which will grant Socrates an extra chance to
battle the bacteria should he be overwhelmed. If Socrates steps onto these items, he will
pick them up. Dr. Evyyl will also occasionally drop deadly fungi into the dish to harm
6
Socrates; Socrates should stay away from those if he can. From time to time, each of
these (good and bad) objects will appear around the perimeter of the dish and will
disappear after a short time (they dissolve in the corrosive agar of the dish).
